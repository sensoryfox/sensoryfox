- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @sensoryfox
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m CEO of SensoryLAB LLC
- SensoryLAB LLC is a company at the intersection of three technological areas: 1) neuro; 2) sensorics; and 3) datascience.

In this repository we will work on such projects as NeuroCUBE, NeuroAir, Jalo and others.

We are doing research on odor and olfaction using partnered neural headsets and the NeuroAIR scent diffuser we have developed. 
We conduct research in the NeuroCube, a standardized room for neurophysiological research.
We would be very happy to work together on open source projects!
